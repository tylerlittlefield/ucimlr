<meta property="og:title" content="Challenger USA Space Shuttle O-Rings — challenger" />

<meta property="og:description" content="Edited from (Draper, 1993): The motivation for collecting this database was
the explosion of the USA Space Shuttle Challenger on 28 January, 1986. An
investigation ensued into the reliability of the shuttle's propulsion system.
The explosion was eventually traced to the failure of one of the three field
joints on one of the two solid booster rockets.  Each of these six field
joints includes two O-rings, designated as primary and secondary, which
fail when phenomena called erosion and blowby both occur. The night before
the launch a decision had to be made regarding launch safety. The discussion
among engineers and managers leading to this decision included concern that
the probability of failure of the O-rings depended on the temperature t at
launch, which was forecase to be 31 degrees F. There are strong engineering
reasons based on the composition of O-rings to support the judgment that
failure probability may rise monotonically as temperature drops. One other
variable, the pressure s at which safety testing for field join leaks
was performed, was available, but its relevance to the failure process
was unclear. Draper's paper includes a menacing figure graphing the number
of field joints experiencing stress vs. liftoff temperature for the 23
shuttle flights previous to the Challenger disaster.  No previous liftoff
temperature was under 53 degrees F.  Although tremendous extrapolation
must be done from the given data to assess risk at 31 degrees F, it
is obvious even to the layman &quot;to foresee the unacceptably high risk
created by launching at 31 degrees F.&quot;  For more information, see Draper
(1993) or the other previous analyses. The task is to predict the number of
O-rings that will experience thermal distress for a given flight when the
launch temperature is below freezing." />
