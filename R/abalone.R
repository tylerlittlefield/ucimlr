#' Predicting the age of abalone from physical measurements. The age of abalone
#' is determined by cutting the shell through the cone, staining it, and
#' counting the number of rings through a microscope -- a boring and
#' time-consuming task. Other measurements, which are easier to obtain, are
#' used to predict the age. Further information, such as weather patterns and
#' location (hence food availability) may be required to solve the problem.
